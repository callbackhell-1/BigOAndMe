#  BigOAndMe

Welcome to **BigOAndMe** – a personal journey through the world of algorithms, complexity analysis, and systems-level problem solving.

This repository is more than just a collection of problems — it’s a journal of how I reason through code, approach performance trade-offs, and build intuition for designing scalable solutions. Every function here is written with clarity and intent, with Big O always in the rearview mirror.

## 🚀 Why This Exists

While many approach coding challenges for interview prep, **BigOAndMe** is focused on building a mindset:

- Think in terms of **efficiency**, not just correctness.
- Understand **trade-offs** before jumping into code.
- Grow beyond solutions — toward **problem modeling**.
